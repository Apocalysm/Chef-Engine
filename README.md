# Chef-Engine
Chef Engine is a game engine made in C++.


The engine is composition-based using components much like those in Unity Engine.

Rendering to the window and using sprites and such is made by using SFML.www.sfml-dev.org/

The Engine has support for .TMX-files exported from Tile Editor. www.mapeditor.org/

We use LuaBridge to be able to script in Lua.
LuaBridge fork we're using: www.github.com/HoggeL/tmxparser
